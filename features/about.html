                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>Founded in 1995, Lead Way Church began as a small gathering of believers in a modest community hall in Lagos, Nigeria. Guided by a vision to spread the transformative power of the Word of God, the church was established under the leadership of Pastor Ezekiel Adebayo. Over the decades, Lead Way Church has grown into a vibrant community, touching thousands of lives through its unwavering commitment to biblical teachings and moral values.</p>
                <p>The early years were marked by fervent prayer meetings and outreach programs aimed at uplifting the marginalized. By 2005, the church had built its first permanent sanctuary, a testament to the faith and generosity of its members. Today, Lead Way Church stands as a beacon of hope, with ministries spanning community service, youth empowerment, and global missions, all rooted in the belief that God’s Word brings healing and deliverance.</p>

                <h3>Our Pastor</h3>
                <p>Pastor Ezekiel Adebayo received a divine call in 1990 to save the oppressed, heal the brokenhearted, and deliver those caged by despair. Born in a small village in Ogun State, Nigeria, Pastor Ezekiel grew up with a deep sense of compassion for the suffering. During a life-changing encounter with God, he was commissioned to lead a ministry that would bring light to those in darkness. His calling, inspired by Isaiah 61:1, became the cornerstone of Lead Way Church’s mission.</p>
                <p>With a heart for service, Pastor Ezekiel has dedicated over three decades to preaching the gospel, counseling the hurting, and empowering communities. His dynamic sermons, grounded in scripture, have inspired countless individuals to find freedom and purpose. Under his leadership, the church has become a sanctuary for those seeking spiritual restoration and moral guidance.</p>
